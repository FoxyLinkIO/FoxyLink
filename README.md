## Quick start

It's easy to start using it with any configuration on "1C:Enterprise 8" platform, requirements:
- Platform version: 
    - 8.3.10.2699 (minimal, SocialNetwork subsystem unsupported)
    - **recommended 8.3.11.2924** and higher
- Data lock control mode: **Managed**
- Compatibility mode: **8.3.10** and higher
- «1C:Enterprise 8» server cluster and Database server for the best performance 

FoxyLink subsystem is available as configuration, so you can install it using command:
```1C:Enterprise 8 -> Designer -> Configuration -> Compare and merge with configuration from file...```.

## Overview

FoxyLink provides an unified programming model to handle integration tasks in a reliable way and run them on 1C:Enterprise server cluster. You can start with a simple setup and grow computational power for integration jobs with time for these scenarios: 

- incredibly easy way to output reports in JSON, CSV, XML, etc.
- integration with different business intelligence systems
- fire-and-forget jobs
- mass notifications/newsletters
- export data to JSON, CSV, XML, etc.
- export data with arbitrary hierarchy  
- creation of messages for message exchange systems
- plugins support
- *...and so on*
